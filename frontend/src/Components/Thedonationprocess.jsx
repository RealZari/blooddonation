                    Giving blood is simple and it saves lives. When you give blood, it is collected so it can be used to treat someone else.

                    For most people, giving blood is easy and follows the simple steps listed below. See our animation which takes you through what happens step by step.

                <p>Remember to bring your completed donation safety check form with you, if you received one from us in the post.
                    We will ask you to read our donor consent booklet which explains the importance of blood safety.
                    It’s important to read this whenever you attend because advice does change. We will give you 500ml
                    of fluid just before you give blood.
                    Drinking this over about 5 minutes will help with your well-being during and after donation.</p>

                <p>When you are comfortable on the chair we will ask you to confirm your name, address and date of birth.

                    We examine your arm and place a cuff on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during donation (this does not measure blood pressure).

                    We then examine your arm to find a suitable vein and clean it with an antiseptic sponge. If we're unable to draw blood first time, we will not make a second attempt on a less suitable vein - this is to keep all our donors safe. </p>
                   <ul className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 mt-3">
                    <li>We will insert a needle in your arm which will collect your blood into a blood bag with your unique donor number. </li>
                    <li>You should not feel any discomfort or pain. If you do, tell a member of staff.</li>
                    <li>A scale weighs the blood and stops when you have donated 470ml (or just under a pint). This usually takes between 5-10 minutes</li>
                    <li>The needle will be removed, and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.</li>
